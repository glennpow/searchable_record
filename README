SearchableRecord
================

# Adds search method to ActiveRecord::Base.
# The query language supports the operators
# (), not, and, or
# Precedence in that order.
# - is an alias for not.
# If no operator is present, and is assumed.
# Lastly, anything within double quotes is treated as 
# a single search term.
#
# For example,
#  ruby rails => records where both ruby and rails appear
#  "ruby on rails" => records where "ruby on rails" appears
#  ruby or rails => records where ruby or rails (or both) appears
#  ruby or chunky bacon => records where ruby appears or both chunky and bacon appear
#  not dead or alive => records where alive appears or dead is absent
#  -(ruby or rails) => records where neither ruby nor rails appears
#  (ruby or rails) -"ruby on rails" => records where ruby or rails appears but not the phrase "ruby on rails"

    # Search the model's text and varchar fields
    #   text = a set of words to search for
    #   :only => an array of fields in which to search for the text;
    #     default is 'all text or string columns'
    #   :except => an array of fields to exclude
    #     from the default searchable columns
    #   :case => :sensitive or :insensitive
    #   :search_include => an array of tables to include in the joins.  Fields that
    #     have searchable text will automatically be included in the default
    #     set of :search_columns.
    #   :include => an array of tables to include in the joins, but only
    #     for joining. (Searchable fields will not automatically be included.)
    #   :conditions => a string of additional conditions (constraints)
    #   :page => paging offset (integer)
    #   :per_page => number of rows to return (integer)
    #   :order => sort order (order_by SQL snippet)
